## Start Claude Code

Now that Claude Code is installed, let's start it and get the course materials.

## Step 1: Open Your Terminal

- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type "cmd", press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

## Step 2: Start Claude Code

Navigate to where you want to store your projects:

```bash
cd ~/Projects  # or wherever you keep your work
```

Then start Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code interface appear in your terminal.

## Step 3: Clone Markit

Markit is the sample marketing agency project we'll use throughout this course. Ask Claude to clone it:

```
Clone the Markit starter project from cc4-marketing/markit-starter
```

Claude will:
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the project structure
3. Configure initial settings

## Step 4: Explore the Structure

Once cloned, you'll see this structure:

```
markit/
├── .claude/               # Claude Code configuration
│   └── agents/           # Custom AI agents
├── campaigns/            # Your campaign briefs and plans
├── content/              # Generated content
│   ├── blogs/
│   ├── emails/
│   └── social/
├── research/             # Competitive and market research
├── templates/            # Reusable templates
└── CLAUDE.md             # Project memory (brand guidelines)
```

### Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.claude/` | Configuration and custom agents |
| `campaigns/` | Campaign briefs, plans, calendars |
| `content/` | All generated marketing content |
| `research/` | Market research and analysis |
| `templates/` | Reusable document templates |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Your brand voice and guidelines |

## Step 5: Open in Claude Code

Make sure you're in the project directory:

```bash
cd markit
claude
```

Claude Code will automatically read your `CLAUDE.md` file and understand your project context.
