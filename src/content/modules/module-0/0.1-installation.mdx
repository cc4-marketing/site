## Install Claude Code

Claude Code now comes with a native installer - no Node.js or coding knowledge required!

## Step 1: Download Claude Code

### Mac / Linux / WSL

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

Download the installer from [https://claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Create a free account if you don't have one
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Click **Create Key**
5. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-ant-`)

> **Important**: Keep your API key private! Never share it or commit it to version control.

## Step 3: Configure Your API Key

Set your API key as an environment variable:

### Mac / Linux

Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-your-key-here'
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

Set an environment variable through System Properties, or run:

```powershell
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see the version number (e.g., `claude 2025.1.0`).

Then run the diagnostic:

```bash
claude doctor
```

This checks that:
- Claude Code is installed correctly
- Your API key is valid
- You have network access

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: claude"

Your shell might not have reloaded. Try:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

Or open a new terminal window.

### "Invalid API key"

Double-check that:
1. You copied the full key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
2. There are no extra spaces
3. You reloaded your shell after setting the variable

### Still having issues?

Run `claude doctor` for detailed diagnostics, or check the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code).
