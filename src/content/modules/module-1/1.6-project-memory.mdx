# Planerio Marketing Project

## Brand Overview
- Product: Planerio - Team productivity coordination tool

- Tone: Professional but approachable, knowledgeable but not condescending

## Brand Voice
- Use active voice
- Be conversational but not casual
- Lead with benefits, then features
- Use "we" and "you" (not "our customers" or "users")
- Avoid jargon unless necessary

## Key Messages
1. Remote teams struggle to coordinate deep work time

## Target Personas

## Content Preferences
- Blog posts: 1200-1800 words
- Emails: 150-250 words max
- Social posts: Platform-specific best lengths
- Always include clear CTAs
- Use statistics and data when available

## SEO Keywords
Primary: remote team productivity, focus time coordination
Secondary: team deep work, remote work focus, productivity coordination

## Never
- Don't compare directly to competitors by name in public content
- Don't make claims we can't back up
- Don't use "world-class", "revolutionary", or other hyperbolic terms

```

## What to Include in Your CLAUDE.md

### Essential Sections

- **Brand Voice:** How you communicate
- **Target Audience:** Who you're talking to

- **Do's and Don'ts:** Specific guidelines

### Optional But Helpful

- Competitor context
- Common objections and how to address them

## How Claude Uses CLAUDE.md

Once CLAUDE.md exists, Claude automatically:

- Applies brand voice to all content generated
- References target personas
- Follows content guidelines
- Uses approved messaging
- Avoids flagged terms or approaches

You don't need to remind Claude each time - it's automatic!
