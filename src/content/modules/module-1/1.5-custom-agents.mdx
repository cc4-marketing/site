## Creating Specialized Marketing Reviewers

Custom sub-agents are specialized AI personas you create to review and improve your marketing work. Think of them as expert consultants with specific expertise who provide consistent, high-quality feedback on your campaigns.

### What You'll Learn

- Creating custom marketing reviewer personas
- Building a brand voice guardian
- SEO and conversion optimization reviewers
- Using sub-agents for quality control
- Maintaining consistency across campaigns

## Why Custom Sub-Agents?

Every piece of marketing content should be reviewed from multiple angles:

- **Brand Consistency:** Does it match our voice?
- **SEO:** Is it optimized for search?
- **Conversion:** Will it drive action?
- **Clarity:** Is the message clear?
- **Engagement:** Will people care?

Custom sub-agents give you on-demand experts for each of these areas.

## Creating Your First Sub-Agent: Brand Voice Guardian

Let's create a sub-agent that ensures all content matches your brand voice:

```
Create a custom reviewer persona called "Brand Voice Guardian" and save it
in brand/reviewers/brand-voice-guardian.md

This reviewer should:
- Know our brand voice guidelines from brand/voice-guide.md
- Understand our target personas
- Check for tone, language, and messaging consistency
- Flag off-brand phrases or approaches
- Suggest improvements to align with brand

Include:
1. Reviewer persona description
2. What they look for
3. Common issues they catch
4. How they provide feedback
5. Example review format
```

```

## Using Your Custom Sub-Agents

Once created, invoke your sub-agents to review content:

Please have these reviewers evaluate it:

1. Brand Voice Guardian (use brand/reviewers/brand-voice-guardian.md)

Each should provide:

## Creating Industry-Specific Reviewers

For your specific industry, create specialized reviewers:

- Free trial vs demo positioning
- Pricing page optimization
- Feature release communications

```

## The Review Board: Multiple Sub-Agents Together

Use multiple sub-agents together for comprehensive reviews:

```
Assemble a "Review Board" for our new landing page:

Reviewers:
1. Brand Voice Guardian
2. SEO Specialist
3. Conversion Expert
4. Copy Editor
5. SaaS Product Marketing Specialist

Each reviewer should:
- Read the landing page at content/landing-pages/focusflow-home.md
- Evaluate from their expertise area
- Score it 1-10
- List what's working
- List what needs improvement
- Provide specific action items

After all reviews, create a prioritized action plan
Save as content/landing-pages/focusflow-home-review-board.md
```

> **The Power of the Review Board:** This single command gets you feedback equivalent to 5 expert consultations, multiple rounds of revisions, days of back-and-forth, and thousands in consulting fees. And you get it in minutes!

## Iterative Improvement Workflow

```
Let's improve this email campaign iteratively:

ROUND 1: Initial Review
- Have Brand Voice Guardian review content/email/welcome-series-1.md
- Implement their suggestions

ROUND 2: Optimization
- Have Email Specialist review the updated version
- Have Conversion Expert review simultaneously
- Implement improvements

ROUND 3: Polish
- Have Copy Editor do final review
- Make final edits

ROUND 4: Approval
- Have all reviewers do quick final check
- If all score 8+, approve for sending

Document the entire process in content/email/welcome-series-1-improvement-log.md
```

## Creating Persona-Based Reviewers

Create reviewers that represent your target personas:

```
Create three persona-based reviewers:

1. "Manager Mark" Reviewer - brand/reviewers/persona-mark.md
   Reviews content asking: Would this resonate with Manager Mark?
   Checks if pain points, language, and examples match this persona

2. "Founder Fiona" Reviewer - brand/reviewers/persona-fiona.md
   Reviews from a startup founder's perspective
   Evaluates if messaging addresses startup-specific concerns

3. "Director Dana" Reviewer - brand/reviewers/persona-dana.md
   Reviews from enterprise perspective
   Checks for enterprise considerations and concerns

Use these to ensure content resonates with target audiences
```
