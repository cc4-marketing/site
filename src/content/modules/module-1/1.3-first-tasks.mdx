## Real Marketing Work with Claude

Now that you understand the basics, let's dive into actual marketing tasks. In this lesson, you'll complete three common marketing activities that you'll use regularly:

1. Generate marketing copy for multiple channels
2. Analyze competitive positioning
3. Create content ideas and calendars

### What You'll Learn

- How to generate on-brand marketing copy
- Conducting competitor research with Claude
- Creating content strategies and calendars
- Using Claude to brainstorm ideas
- Iterating to improve output quality

## Task 1: Generate Multi-Channel Marketing Copy

One of the most time-consuming marketing tasks is creating copy variations for different channels. Let's use Claude to do this in minutes.

### Your Goal

Create launch announcement copy for Planerio across 5 channels: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, email subject line, and Google Ads headline.

In Claude Code, type:

```
Create launch announcement copy for Planerio across these channels:
1. LinkedIn post (professional, ~200 words)
2. Twitter thread (3-4 tweets)
3. Facebook ad copy (engaging, ~100 words with CTA)
4. Email subject line (5 variations for A/B testing)
5. Google Ads headline (3 variations, max 30 characters each)

Use our brand guidelines. Emphasize the team coordination feature.
Save each in a separate file in the content/ folder.
```

Claude will generate copy for all five channels and save them to individual files. Let's review them:

```
Show me the LinkedIn post
```

### Refining the Output

Maybe the LinkedIn post feels too salesy. Let's refine it:

```
Rewrite the LinkedIn post to be more educational and less promotional.
Focus on the problem of coordinating deep work time in enterprise and large corporations.
```

Claude will update the file with the new version. This iterative process is key to getting perfect copy.

> **Time Saved:** What would normally take 2-3 hours of writing and revising just took 5 minutes. And you can iterate as much as you need!

## Task 2: Competitive Analysis

Understanding your competitors is crucial. Let's use Claude to analyze Planerio's competitive landscape.

### Your Goal

Create a competitive analysis document comparing Planerio to three main competitors: RescueTime, Freedom, and Focus@Will.

Ask Claude:

```
Create a competitive analysis for Planerio comparing us to:
- RescueTime
- Freedom
- Focus@Will

For each competitor, analyze:
- Target audience
- Key features
- Pricing model
- Unique positioning
- Marketing approach
- Strengths and weaknesses vs Planerio

Save this as competitive-analysis.md in the research/ folder.
```

Claude will research these tools and create a comprehensive analysis. You can then ask follow-up questions:

```
Based on this analysis, what's our biggest competitive advantage?
```

```
What marketing angle should we emphasize to differentiate from RescueTime?
```

### Going Deeper

You can ask Claude to dig into specific aspects:

```
Analyze the messaging on RescueTime's homepage.
How do they position themselves?
What pain points do they address?
How is our positioning different?
```

> **Pro Tip:** While Claude has knowledge of many companies, for the most current information, you can provide Claude with website copy or marketing materials to analyze.

## Task 3: Content Strategy & Calendar

Content marketing drives long-term growth. Let's create a content strategy and calendar.

### Your Goal

Create a 30-day content calendar with blog post ideas, social media posts, and email campaigns for Planerio's launch.

Ask Claude:

```
Create a 30-day content marketing calendar for Planerio's launch.

Include:
- 4 blog post topics with SEO keywords
- Daily social media post themes (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- 1 email per week (4 total)
- Content goals for each piece

Focus on:
- Remote work productivity
- Team collaboration
- Deep work
- Managing distractions

Format as a markdown table and save to campaigns/content-calendar.md
```

Claude will generate a detailed content calendar. Let's expand on one of the blog post ideas:

```
Take the first blog post idea from the calendar and create a full outline with:
- Working title
- Target keyword
- Meta description
- H2 section headings
- Key points for each section
- Internal/external linking opportunities
- CTA

Save this as content/blog-post-1-outline.md
```

### Generating the Full Post

Now let's write the actual blog post:

```
Write the full blog post based on the outline.
Aim for 1500-2000 words.
Make it SEO-optimized but natural and engaging.
Include actionable tips and examples.
Save as content/blog-post-1.md
```

> **From Strategy to Execution:** In less than 10 minutes, you went from blank slate to a complete content calendar AND a draft blog post. This is the power of Claude Code for content marketing.

## Task 4: Brainstorming & Ideation

Claude is excellent for brainstorming. Let's generate campaign ideas:

```
Brainstorm 10 creative marketing campaign ideas for Planerio's launch.

For each idea include:
- Campaign name
- Core concept
- Target channel
- Expected outcome
- Rough budget (small/medium/large)

Think outside the box. Include both conventional and unconventional ideas.
```

Claude will generate diverse ideas. Pick your favorite and develop it:

```
I like campaign idea #3. Develop it into a full campaign brief with:
- Detailed strategy
- Execution plan
- Timeline
- Required resources
- Success metrics
- Risk mitigation

Save as campaigns/creative-campaign-brief.md
```

## Advanced: Combining Tasks

You can ask Claude to complete multiple tasks in sequence:

```
For our Planerio launch:

1. Create 5 customer persona documents (save in research/personas/)
2. For each persona, generate personalized ad copy (save in content/ads/)
3. Create a targeting strategy document explaining which channels
   work best for each persona (save in campaigns/targeting-strategy.md)
```

Claude will complete all three tasks, maintaining consistency across all outputs.
