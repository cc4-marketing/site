### What You'll Learn

## Finding Files Quickly

### By Name
```
Find all files with "campaign" in the name
Show me all email templates
List files ending in -draft.md
```

### By Content
```
Find all files that mention "product launch"
Search for files containing our Q2 campaign messaging
Which files reference "Manager Mark" persona?
```

### By Location
```
Show all files in content/blog/
List everything in the campaigns folder and subfolders
What's in research/competitors/?
```

## Advanced Search Patterns

### Combining Criteria
```
Find blog posts from April that mention SEO
Show email templates that include CTAs about free trials
List social posts tagged for LinkedIn in the Q2 folder
```

### Wildcard Searches
```
Find all markdown files in content/ and subdirectories
Show PDFs in the research folder
List all files modified in the last week
```

## Batch Operations

### Update Multiple Files
```
Find all blog posts and update the author bio at the end
Change all instances of "free trial" to "14-day free trial" across email folder
Add copyright year 2024 to footer of all landing pages
```

### Audit Multiple Files
```
Review all social posts in content/social/q2/ and:
- Check if they follow brand voice
- Flag any missing CTAs
- Identify posts without hashtags
- Report which are ready to publish

Create audit report in analytics/q2-social-audit.md
```

## Project Organization

### Archive Old Content
```
Create an archive/ folder
Move all completed Q1 campaigns there
Keep only active campaigns in main campaigns/ folder
```

### Reorganize by Campaign
```
Create campaigns/product-launch/ structure with:
- /brief
- /content
- /assets
- /reports

Move all product launch related files into this structure
Update paths in any files that reference them
```

## Working Across Multiple Files

```
I need to ensure brand consistency across all Q2 content.

Read brand/voice-guide.md
Then review ALL files in content/q2-campaign/
Flag any that don't match brand voice
Provide specific fixes for each

Create report in analytics/q2-brand-consistency-check.md
```
