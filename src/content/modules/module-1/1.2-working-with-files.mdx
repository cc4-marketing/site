## Organizing Your Marketing Projects

As a marketer, you work with many types of files: campaign briefs, content drafts, research documents, analytics reports, brand guidelines, and more. Claude Code makes it easy to organize, find, and work with all these files efficiently.

### What You'll Learn

- How to structure marketing project folders
- Creating and organizing marketing files
- Finding files quickly with search
- Reading and editing multiple files
- Best practices for file organization

## Setting Up Your Marketing Project Structure

A well-organized project structure makes everything easier. Here's a recommended structure for marketing projects:

```
Markit/
├── campaigns/           # Campaign briefs and plans
│   ├── q1-launch/
│   ├── q2-growth/
│   └── templates/
├── content/             # All marketing content
│   ├── blog/
│   ├── email/
│   ├── social/
│   └── ads/
├── brand/              # Brand guidelines and assets
│   ├── voice-guide.md
│   ├── messaging.md
│   └── personas/
├── research/           # Competitive analysis and research
│   ├── competitors/
│   ├── market-data/
│   └── customer-insights/
├── analytics/          # Performance data and reports
│   ├── campaign-reports/
│   └── monthly-reviews/
└── templates/          # Reusable templates
    ├── brief-template.md
    ├── email-template.md
    └── social-template.md
```

Let's create this structure with Claude:

```
Create a complete marketing project structure for Markit with:
- campaigns/ folder with subfolders for q1-launch, q2-growth, templates
- content/ folder with subfolders for blog, email, social, ads
- brand/ folder for brand guidelines
- research/ folder with competitors, market-data, customer-insights
- analytics/ folder for reports
- templates/ folder for reusable templates

Add a README.md in each main folder explaining what goes there.
```

## Creating Marketing Files

Claude can create any type of marketing file you need. The key is being specific about what you want.

### Brand Guidelines

```
Create a comprehensive brand voice guide in brand/voice-guide.md that includes:
- Brand personality traits
- Tone of voice (formal vs casual, serious vs playful)
- Writing style guidelines
- Do's and don'ts
- Example good and bad copy
- Key phrases and terminology we use

Base it on Planerio: professional but approachable, knowledgeable but not condescending.
```

### Customer Personas

```
Create 3 customer persona documents in brand/personas/ for Planerio:

Persona 1: "Manager Mark" - Remote team manager, tech company, 35-45
Persona 2: "Founder Fiona" - Startup founder juggling many roles, 28-35
Persona 3: "Director Dana" - Marketing director at mid-size company, 40-50

For each persona include:
- Demographics
- Role and responsibilities
- Pain points and frustrations
- Current solutions they're using
- Motivations and goals
- Information sources they trust
- How Planerio helps them
```

### Content Templates

```
Create reusable templates in templates/ folder:

1. blog-post-template.md - Structure for blog posts with SEO checklist
2. email-template.md - Framework for marketing emails
3. social-post-template.md - Format for social media posts
4. campaign-brief-template.md - Complete campaign brief structure

Include placeholder text and instructions in each template.
```

## Finding Files

As your project grows, finding specific files becomes important. Claude makes this easy:

### List Files in a Folder
```
Show me all files in the content/blog/ folder
```

### Search for Specific Files
```
Find all files that mention "product launch"
```

### Find Files by Type
```
List all markdown files in the campaigns folder
```

### Search File Contents
```
Search all files for mentions of "email campaign" and show me which files contain it
```

> **Pro Tip: Use Descriptive File Names**
> 
> Name files descriptively so they're easy to find:
> - ✅ `2024-q1-product-launch-brief.md`
> - ❌ `brief1.md`

## Reading and Editing Files

Claude can read and edit any text file in your project.

### Reading Files
```
Read the brand voice guide and summarize the key points
```

```
Show me the content of all persona files
```

### Editing Existing Content
```
Read the blog post in content/blog/productivity-tips.md and:
1. Make the introduction more engaging
2. Add statistics to support the claims
3. Improve the conclusion with a stronger CTA
4. Ensure it matches our brand voice guidelines
```

### Batch Editing
```
Review all email drafts in content/email/ and:
- Ensure subject lines are under 50 characters
- Add personalization tokens where appropriate
- Check CTAs are clear and compelling
- Flag any that don't match our brand voice
```

## Working with Multiple Files

Claude can work with multiple files simultaneously, which is powerful for maintaining consistency.

### Cross-Reference Content
```
Read the brand voice guide and all three persona documents.
Then review the blog post in content/blog/remote-work-tips.md
and tell me:
1. Does it match our brand voice?
2. Which persona is it targeting?
3. How can we make it more relevant to that persona?
```

### Create Related Content
```
Read the campaign brief in campaigns/q1-launch/brief.md
and create supporting content:
1. 5 blog post outlines
2. 10 social media posts
3. 3 email subjects and preview text
4. 5 Google ad headlines

Save each type in the appropriate content/ subfolder.
```

### Maintain Consistency
```
Read our brand messaging doc in brand/messaging.md
Then review all content in content/social/ and:
- Flag any posts that use off-brand language
- Suggest improvements to align with messaging
- Identify which posts are strongest
```

## File Organization Best Practices

### Follow These Principles

- **Group by type and campaign:** Keep related files together
- **Use consistent naming:** Date-campaign-type format works well
- **Create READMEs:** Document what goes in each folder
- **Archive old campaigns:** Move completed campaigns to an archive folder
- **Keep templates separate:** Protect your templates from accidental editing
- **Version important documents:** Use suffixes like v1, v2, or dates

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Organizing a Campaign
```
Create a complete file structure for a Q2 product launch campaign:

In campaigns/q2-launch/ create:
- brief.md (campaign overview)
- timeline.md (project schedule)
- budget.md (budget breakdown)
- team.md (roles and responsibilities)
- assets-needed.md (creative requirements)
- measurement-plan.md (KPIs and tracking)

Then create supporting content in content/:
- 3 blog post outlines in content/blog/
- Email sequence (5 emails) in content/email/q2-launch/
- Social content calendar in content/social/q2-launch/
- Ad copy variations in content/ads/q2-launch/
```

### Example 2: Content Audit
```
Perform a content audit:

1. List all blog posts in content/blog/
2. For each post, create a summary with:
   - Title
   - Target persona
   - Main topic
   - SEO keywords
   - Publish date
   - Performance metrics (if available)
3. Identify content gaps
4. Suggest 10 new post topics to fill those gaps

Save the audit as analytics/content-audit-2024.md
```

### Example 3: Refreshing Old Content
```
Find all blog posts in content/blog/ that are over 6 months old.

For each post:
1. Review if information is still current
2. Check if statistics need updating
3. Assess if SEO can be improved
4. Recommend whether to update, redirect, or retire

Create a content refresh plan in analytics/content-refresh-plan.md
```
