## Introduction to Your Marketing Project

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, you'll learn the core concepts of Claude Code through **Markit**, a realistic marketing agency project. By the end, you'll be able to handle real marketing tasks with confidence.

### What Is Markit?

Markit is a sample marketing agency project where you're working on campaigns for a client called **"Planerio"** - a project management software for enterprise and large corporations. Throughout this module, you'll:

- Create campaign briefs and strategies
- Generate marketing content
- Analyze competitor positioning
- Develop content calendars
- Optimize for SEO

## The Planerio Product

To make this course practical, we need a product to market. Here's the brief:

### Product: Planerio

**Category:** B2B project management platform for enterprise

**Target Audience:** Enterprise project managers, program managers, and C-suite executives (30-55 years old)

**Key Features:**
- Distraction blocking with AI
- Team focus time coordination
- Productivity analytics
- Integration with Slack, Zoom, and Google Workspace

**Pricing:** $12/user/month, 14-day free trial

**Unique Value Prop:** "Coordinate deep work time across your entire team"

## Your Role

You're a Marketing Strategist at Markit agency, working on the Planerio account. Your goals are:

1. Launch the product to market
2. Generate awareness and signups
3. Create content that resonates with enterprise and large corporations
4. Build a sustainable content marketing engine

## Setting Up Markit with Claude

Let's set up the project structure. In Claude Code, type:

```
Create a Markit agency project with the following structure:
- campaigns/ (for campaign briefs)
- content/ (for blog posts, emails, ads)
- research/ (for competitive analysis)
- analytics/ (for performance data)
- brand/ (for brand guidelines)

Also create a README.md that describes the Planerio product.
```

Claude will create all the folders and files for you. Let's verify it worked:

```
Show me the project structure
```

## Creating Your First Marketing File

Let's create a brand guidelines document. This will help Claude understand your brand voice for all future content. Ask Claude:

```
Create a brand guidelines document in the brand/ folder for Planerio. Include:
- Brand voice (professional but friendly, knowledgeable but not condescending)
- Key messaging pillars
- Tone guidelines
- Words to use and avoid
```

Claude will generate a comprehensive brand guidelines document. Review it by asking:

```
Read the brand guidelines file and summarize the key points
```

> **What Just Happened?** You just created a professional brand guidelines document without writing a single word yourself. Claude understood your requirements and created appropriate content based on best practices.

## Understanding Claude's Capabilities

Claude Code can help you with:

### 1. Content Generation

## Working with Context

Claude works best when you provide context. For example, instead of:

**Vague:** "Write an ad"

Try:

**Specific:** "Write a Facebook ad for Planerio targeting enterprise project managers. Emphasize the team coordination feature. Keep it under 125 characters. Use our professional but friendly brand voice from the guidelines."

## The Power of Iteration

Claude Code is designed for iteration. You can refine outputs until they're perfect:

```
1. Initial request: "Write a blog post about productivity"
2. Refine: "Make it more engaging and add statistics"
3. Refine: "Add a section about remote work challenges"
4. Refine: "Make the conclusion more actionable"
```

## Exercise: Create Your First Campaign Brief

Let's put this into practice. Ask Claude to create a campaign brief for Planerio's launch:

```
Create a campaign brief for Planerio's product launch in the campaigns/ folder. Include:
- Campaign objectives
- Target audience details
- Key messages
- Channel strategy
- Success metrics
- Timeline

Base it on the product information and brand guidelines we created.
```

Claude will analyze the existing files (product info and brand guidelines) and create a comprehensive campaign brief.

> **Pro Tip:** Notice how Claude can reference other files in your project. This is called **context awareness**, and it's one of Claude's most powerful features for marketers.
