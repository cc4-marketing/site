## What Makes a Great Campaign Brief?

A campaign brief is the foundation of successful marketing execution. It should include:

- **Executive Summary:** Campaign at a glance
- **Background & Context:** Why this campaign, why now
- **Campaign Objectives:** Specific, measurable goals
- **Target Audience:** Detailed personas and insights
- **Key Messages:** What we're saying and why it matters
- **Creative Strategy:** The big idea and how we'll express it
- **Channel Strategy:** Where we'll reach our audience
- **Timeline & Milestones:** When things happen
- **Budget & Resources:** What we need to execute
- **Success Metrics:** How we'll measure performance

## The Collaborative Approach

The best way to use Claude for campaign briefs is **collaboratively**. You provide strategic input and context, Claude helps structure, research, and articulate your ideas.

> **Important Mindset:** Claude is your strategic partner, not a replacement for your marketing expertise. You bring the insights, market knowledge, and strategic thinking. Claude helps you articulate and structure those ideas effectively.

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Campaign Brief

Let's create a comprehensive campaign brief for Planerio's product launch.

### Step 1: Start with Strategy Input

First, provide Claude with your strategic thinking:

```
I need to create a campaign brief for Planerio's product launch.

Here's my strategic thinking:
- Primary goal: 1000 trial signups in first 30 days
- Target: Remote team managers at tech companies (50-500 employees)
- Key differentiator: Team-wide focus time coordination
- Main competitors: RescueTime, Freedom app
- Budget: $50k for paid channels
- Launch date: June 1st
- Core insight: Remote teams struggle to find overlap time for deep work

Create a comprehensive campaign brief based on this. Include all standard sections and make it professional and thorough.
```

### Step 2: Review and Refine Structure

Claude will generate a draft brief. Review it and refine specific sections:

```
The target audience section needs more depth. Add:
- Detailed persona (give them a name)
- Day in the life
- Pain points and frustrations
- Current solutions they're using
- Motivations and goals
- Preferred information sources
```

### Step 3: Add Research and Data

Strengthen the brief with research:

```
Add a market research section that includes:
- Remote work trends and statistics
- Productivity app market size
- Competitor analysis summary
- Target audience size estimation
- Industry insights about team coordination challenges

Research this information and add it to the brief.
```

### Step 4: Develop Creative Strategy

Work with Claude on the creative approach:

```
Expand the creative strategy section. Include:
- Big idea / campaign concept
- Creative territories to explore
- Tone and voice
- Visual direction (describe, not design)
- Message architecture
- Proof points and supporting evidence
- Calls-to-action strategy
```

### Step 5: Detail the Channel Strategy

Get specific about execution:

```
Create a detailed channel strategy section with:

For each channel (LinkedIn, Google Ads, Content Marketing, Email):
- Why this channel
- Target audience segment
- Key messages tailored to channel
- Budget allocation
- Success metrics
- Example tactics

Format as a table for easy reference.
```

### Step 6: Add Timeline and Project Plan

```
Create a project timeline from now until 30 days post-launch.

Include:
- Pre-launch activities (creative development, asset creation, testing)
- Launch week activities
- Post-launch optimization
- Key milestones and deadlines
- Team responsibilities

Format as a Gantt-style timeline.
```

## Getting Feedback on Your Brief

Now for the powerful part - getting multi-perspective feedback. Ask Claude to review the brief from different viewpoints:

### Executive Perspective
```
Review this campaign brief from an executive/stakeholder perspective.
Look for:
- Unclear objectives or success metrics
- Missing business context
- Budget justification
- Risk assessment
- ROI projection

Provide constructive feedback.
```

### Creative Perspective
```
Review the creative strategy section from a creative director's perspective.
- Is the creative brief clear enough to execute?
- Are there constraints that might limit creativity?
- Is the tone and messaging compelling?
- Are there opportunities we're missing?
```

### Channel Specialist Perspective
```
Review the channel strategy as a digital marketing specialist.
- Is the budget allocation realistic?
- Are we choosing the right channels for this audience?
- Are the tactics specific enough?
- Are there channel opportunities we're overlooking?
```

> **The Power of Multiple Perspectives:** In a traditional agency, getting this kind of feedback requires meetings with multiple teams. With Claude, you can get diverse perspectives in minutes, helping you create a more robust brief.

## Creating Supporting Documents

Once your brief is solid, generate supporting materials:

### Creative Brief
```
Based on the campaign brief, create a separate creative brief for the design team.

Include:
- Project overview
- Objectives
- Target audience
- Single-minded proposition
- Supporting points
- Tone and manner
- Mandatories (logo usage, brand guidelines, etc.)
- Deliverables list

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-creative-brief.md
```

### Media Brief
```
Create a media brief for our media buying team or agency.

Include:
- Campaign objectives
- Target audience demographics and psychographics
- Media budget breakdown
- Flight dates
- Geographic targeting
- Suggested channels and tactics
- KPIs for each channel
- Competitive context

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-media-brief.md
```

### Measurement Plan
```
Create a detailed measurement and reporting plan.

Include:
- Primary and secondary KPIs
- How we'll track each metric
- Tools and platforms needed
- Reporting cadence
- Dashboard requirements
- Success thresholds
- Optimization triggers (when to adjust strategy)

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-measurement-plan.md
```

## Advanced: Scenario Planning

Use Claude to think through different scenarios:

```
Create three scenario plans for the Planerio launch:

1. Best case: What if we hit 150% of our goal?
2. Base case: What if we hit our goal exactly?
3. Worst case: What if we only hit 50% of our goal?

For each scenario:
- What would cause it
- How we'd respond
- Budget implications
- Timeline adjustments
- Lessons learned

This helps us prepare for different outcomes.
```

## Best Practices

### Tips for Campaign Briefs

- **Start with strategy:** Don't ask Claude to generate strategy from scratch. Provide your strategic thinking.
- **Iterate section by section:** Don't try to perfect everything at once.
- **Be specific with numbers:** Goals, budgets, timelines - specificity leads to better briefs.
- **Use multiple perspectives:** Get feedback from different viewpoints.
- **Create supporting docs:** Break complex briefs into role-specific documents.
- **Save templates:** Reuse structures that work.

## Exercise: Create Your Own Campaign Brief

Now it's your turn. Choose one of these scenarios and create a complete campaign brief:

1. **E-commerce:** Black Friday campaign for a sustainable fashion brand
2. **B2B SaaS:** Webinar series to generate enterprise leads
3. **Mobile App:** User acquisition campaign for a meditation app
4. **Local Business:** Grand opening campaign for a coffee shop

Include all sections we covered, get feedback from multiple perspectives, and create at least two supporting documents.
