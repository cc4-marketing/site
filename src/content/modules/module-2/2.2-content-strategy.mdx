Create integrated multi-channel content plan:

For each blog post, automatically create:

1. BLOG POST
   - 1500-2000 words
   - SEO optimized
   - With images and CTAs

2. SOCIAL MEDIA DERIVATIVES
   - LinkedIn article (shortened version)
   - Twitter thread (key points)
   - Facebook post (with video hook)
   - Instagram carousel (visual highlights)

3. EMAIL CONTENT
   - Newsletter feature (summary + link)
   - Drip sequence snippet (for specific persona)

4. REPURPOSED FORMATS
   - Slide deck for SlideShare
   - Video script for YouTube
