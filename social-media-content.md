### English - Angle: "The Secret Weapon"

**Tweet 1:**
I spent 3 hours on a campaign brief last week.

My colleague did the same thing in 18 minutes.

Same quality. Same depth. Same client approval.

The difference? He learned Claude Code for marketing.

Here's what I discovered: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Most marketers use AI like a fancy Google search.

"Write me 10 captions"
"Give me blog ideas"
"Summarize this article"

That's not AI-powered marketing.

That's copy-paste with extra steps.

**Tweet 3:**
The top 1% of marketers are doing something different.

They're not prompting AI.

They're WORKING WITH AI.

Building custom agents. Creating workflows. Shipping 5x more campaigns.

**Tweet 4:**
The tool? Claude Code.

The same thing developers use to build software.

But for marketing.

- Campaign briefs in minutes
- Content strategy on autopilot
- Brand consistency at 89%
- Custom AI reviewers for YOUR brand voice

**Tweet 5:**
The best part?

There's now a course that teaches this.

Not through videos.
Not through slides.

You learn INSIDE Claude Code itself.

Type /start-0-0 and Claude teaches you step by step.

**Tweet 6:**
It's called cc4.marketing

3 modules. 18 lessons. 2 weeks.

You'll work on real campaigns for a fictional B2B SaaS client.

By the end, you'll have your own AI marketing workflow.

**Tweet 7:**
The question isn't "Will AI replace marketers?"

It's "Will marketers who use AI replace those who don't?"

The answer is yes. It's happening now.

### Vietnamese - Angle: "Câu chuyện thật"

**Tweet 1:**
Tuần trước tôi mất 3 tiếng để làm campaign brief.

Đồng nghiệp tôi làm xong trong 18 phút.

Cùng chất lượng. Cùng độ chi tiết. Client duyệt luôn.

Khác biệt? Anh ấy biết dùng Claude Code cho marketing.

Đây là những gì tôi khám phá: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
90% marketer dùng AI như Google Search 2.0

"Viết 10 caption"
"Cho tôi ý tưởng blog"
"Tóm tắt bài này"

Đó không phải AI-powered marketing.

Đó là copy-paste có thêm bước.

**Tweet 3:**
10% còn lại đang làm khác hoàn toàn.

Họ không "prompt" AI.

Họ LÀM VIỆC VỚI AI.

Build agent riêng. Tạo workflow. Ship gấp 5 lần campaign.

**Tweet 4:**
Tool họ dùng? Claude Code.

Thứ developer dùng để code.

Nhưng cho marketing.

- Campaign brief trong vài phút
- Content strategy tự động
- Brand consistency 89%
- AI reviewer riêng cho brand voice của BẠN

**Tweet 5:**
Phần hay nhất?

Giờ có khóa học dạy cái này.

Không qua video.
Không qua slide.

Bạn học TRONG Claude Code luôn.

Gõ /start-0-0 và Claude dạy bạn từng bước.

**Tweet 6:**
cc4.marketing

3 modules. 18 lessons. 2 tuần.

Bạn sẽ làm campaign thật cho client B2B SaaS ảo.

Kết thúc, bạn có workflow AI marketing của riêng mình.

**Tweet 7:**
Câu hỏi không còn là "AI có thay marketer không?"

Mà là "Marketer biết AI có thay marketer không biết AI không?"

Câu trả lời là có. Đang xảy ra rồi.

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST

### English - Angle: "The Productivity Gap"

**Post:**

Last month, I tracked my marketing team's productivity.

The results shocked me.

**Team Member A:** 4 campaigns shipped
**Team Member B:** 21 campaigns shipped

Same role. Same hours. Same salary.

The difference wasn't talent or experience.

It was HOW they used AI.

---

Team Member A used ChatGPT like most people:
→ Random prompts
→ Copy-paste outputs
→ Manual editing for hours

Team Member B used Claude Code:
→ Custom AI agents for our brand voice
→ Automated workflows for repetitive tasks
→ Real-time collaboration with AI on strategy

---

Here's what I learned:

The AI productivity gap in marketing isn't about USING AI.

Everyone uses AI now.

It's about knowing how to BUILD WITH AI.

---

I found a resource that teaches exactly this: cc4.marketing

It's a course taught entirely INSIDE Claude Code.

No passive video watching.
You learn by doing real marketing work.

Campaign briefs. Content strategy. Competitive analysis.

All while Claude guides you step-by-step.

---

The marketers who master this will outperform teams 5x their size.

The ones who don't will wonder why they're working harder but falling behind.

Which one will you be?

### Vietnamese - Angle: "Khoảng cách năng suất"

**Post:**

Tháng trước, tôi theo dõi năng suất của team marketing.

Kết quả khiến tôi sốc.

**Nhân viên A:** Ship 4 campaigns
**Nhân viên B:** Ship 21 campaigns

Cùng vị trí. Cùng giờ làm. Cùng lương.

Khác biệt không phải talent hay kinh nghiệm.

Mà là CÁCH họ dùng AI.

---

Nhân viên A dùng ChatGPT như đa số:
→ Prompt ngẫu nhiên
→ Copy-paste output
→ Sửa tay hàng tiếng

Nhân viên B dùng Claude Code:
→ AI agent riêng cho brand voice của công ty
→ Workflow tự động cho việc lặp đi lặp lại
→ Collab real-time với AI về strategy

---

Đây là điều tôi học được:

Khoảng cách năng suất AI trong marketing không phải về DÙNG AI.

Ai cũng dùng AI rồi.

Mà là về biết BUILD VỚI AI.

---

Tôi tìm được resource dạy đúng cái này: cc4.marketing

Đây là khóa học dạy hoàn toàn TRONG Claude Code.

Không xem video thụ động.
Bạn học bằng cách làm việc marketing thật.

Campaign briefs. Content strategy. Competitive analysis.

Tất cả trong khi Claude hướng dẫn bạn từng bước.

---

Marketer master được cái này sẽ outperform team gấp 5 lần size của họ.

Người không làm được sẽ tự hỏi tại sao mình làm nhiều hơn mà vẫn tụt lại.

Bạn sẽ là ai?

Uncomfortable truth about marketing in 2025:

Your job security isn't about how good you are.

It's about how fast you can work WITH AI.

I've seen junior marketers with Claude Code outperform seniors with 10+ years experience.

Not because they're smarter.

Because they learned to leverage AI as a partner, not just a tool.

**Post 3:**
The old way:
- Spend 4 hours on research
- 2 hours on brief
- 3 hours on copy
- Endless revisions

The new way:

- Better output
- More iterations
- Happier clients

**Post 4:**

### Vietnamese - Angle: "Sự thật khó chịu"

Sự thật khó chịu về marketing 2025:

Job security của bạn không phụ thuộc vào bạn giỏi cỡ nào.

Mà vào việc bạn làm việc VỚI AI nhanh cỡ nào.

## 📝 SUBSTACK NOTES

### English - Angle: "The Marketing Skills Gap"

**Note 1:**
There's a new skills gap in marketing.

It's not about creativity vs. data.
It's not about brand vs. performance.

It's about AI-native vs. AI-tourist.

AI tourists use ChatGPT for random tasks.
AI natives build systems that compound.

The gap is widening every day.

**Note 2:**
Just discovered something interesting.

There's a course that teaches marketing entirely INSIDE an AI coding tool (Claude Code).

No videos. You open your terminal, type a command, and Claude literally teaches you while you work.

You build real campaigns. Create AI agents. Ship actual deliverables.

It's called cc4.marketing and it might be the most innovative approach to marketing education I've seen.

The future of learning isn't watching. It's doing.

**Note 3:**
Hot take: The best marketing course in 2025 won't be taught by a human.

It'll be taught BY AI, ABOUT AI, INSIDE AI.

cc4.marketing is exactly this.

AI native build system compound theo thời gian.

Khoảng cách đang rộng ra mỗi ngày.

**Note 2:**
Vừa khám phá điều thú vị.

Có khóa học dạy marketing hoàn toàn BÊN TRONG AI coding tool (Claude Code).

Tương lai của learning không phải watching. Mà là doing.
