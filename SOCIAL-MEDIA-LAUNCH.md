I built a free course to help marketers learn Claude Code.

It's not a video course. It's not a PDF.

You download the course, open it in Claude Code, type /start-0-0, and Claude teaches you step by step.

What you'll learn:
→ How to use Claude Code for marketing work
→ Building campaign briefs with AI assistance
→ Creating content strategies
→ Writing marketing copy faster
→ Analyzing competitors
→ SEO optimization

It includes a practice project where you work as a marketing agency (Markit) for a real client scenario.

16 lessons. 3 modules. Completely free.

I made this because I believe AI tools should make marketers better, not replace them. The best way to learn is by doing.

**Title:** I built a free interactive course to learn Claude Code for marketing work

Hey everyone,

I've been using Claude Code for marketing work and realized there's no good resource for marketers to learn it properly. So I built one.

**What makes it different:**

Instead of watching videos or reading docs, you learn inside Claude Code itself. You download the course materials, open them in Claude Code, type `/start-0-0`, and Claude guides you through each lesson.

**What's covered:**

- Module 0: Getting started with Claude Code
- Module 1: Fundamentals (working with files, agents, project memory)
- Module 2: Marketing workflows (briefs, content strategy, copy, SEO, competitor analysis)

**It includes:**

- 16 interactive lessons
- A practice project (you're a marketing agency working for a B2B SaaS client)
- Marketing plugins for campaign workflows

**Why free?**

I genuinely believe AI tools should help marketers work smarter. The best way to learn is hands-on, and I wanted to lower the barrier.

Check it out: cc4.marketing

Happy to answer any questions or take feedback. This is v0.1.0 so there's definitely room to improve.

**Title:** Free course: Learn to use Claude Code for marketing workflows

Hey r/marketing,

I put together a free course specifically for marketers who want to learn Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding tool).

**Why Claude Code for marketing?**

It's incredibly useful for:
- Writing and iterating on marketing copy
- Building campaign briefs
- Creating content strategies
- Competitor research
- SEO analysis

**What's different about this course:**

You learn by actually using Claude Code. Download the materials, open in Claude Code, type `/start-0-0`, and it teaches you interactively.

**Course includes:**
- 16 hands-on lessons
- Practice project (you're a marketing agency with a real client scenario)
- Templates and workflows you can reuse

It's free. No email required to access the materials (though there's an optional signup for updates).

Would love feedback from anyone who tries it!

**Title:** Built an interactive course that teaches you inside Claude Code

Thought this community might find this interesting.

I built a course where Claude Code teaches you how to use itself. Instead of external videos or docs, you download the course, open it in Claude Code, and type `/start-0-0` to begin.

Claude then walks you through 16 lessons interactively, with hands-on exercises in a practice project.

It's focused on marketing use cases (campaign briefs, content strategy, copywriting, SEO) but the fundamentals apply to any Claude Code user.

Free and open source: cc4.marketing (GitHub: cc4-marketing/cc4.marketing)

The "learning inside the tool" approach worked really well for me. Curious if others have seen similar interactive learning methods for AI tools.

Here's how it works:

16 lessons covering everything from basics to real marketing workflows like writing campaign briefs, content strategies, and SEO optimization.

It also includes a practice project where you work as a marketing agency for a fictional client. Real scenarios, real learning.

I built this because I think every marketer should know how to use AI tools effectively. And the best way to learn is by doing.

Completely free. No catch.
